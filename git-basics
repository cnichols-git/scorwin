git status

# This is the go to for the most part 
# I truncated all the text and just added to meat here

##
# The commands and order to run them


git status
git add
git commit -m "add a message here"
git push

after git add I check status again and it will tell you what is next
then I commit and again git status, then git push and again git status to see if all is updated or if I screwed something up.  


once you push you will need to add username and pw

# I was going to add a bunch of instructions, but it looked super messy and you pretty sharp. I think you will get it or ask good questions.
