# The Project
#

# Set up three CentOS 7 systems

Name them the following:
server-main
server-alpha
server-beta

Install with whatever your want in Virtualbox ram and what not.

server-main will be where you install a webserver.
server-alpha is where you will develop you code for the site. 
server-beta will be for other software instances as we go.

Main Goal:
- have a CentOS-7 server provide a webpage that says "hello world!" in a browser.
