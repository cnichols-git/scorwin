# The Project

# Set up three CentOS 7 systems

Name them the following:
server-main
server-alpha
server-beta

Install with whatever your want in Virtualbox ram and what not.

server-main will be where you install a webserver.
server-alpha is where you will develop you code for the site. 
server-beta will be for other software instances as we go.

Main Goal:
- have a CentOS-7 server provide a webpage that says "hello world!" in a browser.

'*'COMPLETE'*'
However, I tried to add an image to my webpage and it never shows?  I SCP'ed the file from my ubuntu onto my webserver in the proper directory and it never showed.
It has been years since I've done html coding, so I'm sure I could figure it out, I'm just surprised it didn't come to me sooner.... but it says "HELLO WORLD" in bold now!
...maybe I did it wrong, I developed my code directly on the server-main. I edited the index.html file directly from there, where I installed the web server.
